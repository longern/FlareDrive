CloudFlare R2 storage manager with Pages and Workers. Free 10 GB storage. Free serverless backend with a limit of 100,000 invocation requests per day. [More about pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/platform/pricing/)

## Usage

### Installation

Before starting, you should make sure that

- you have created a [CloudFlare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) account
- your payment method is added
- R2 service is activated and at least one bucket is created

Steps:

1. Fork this project and connect your fork with CloudFlare Pages
2. Add a custom domain (e.g. `mydrive.domain.com`)
3. Bind R2 buckets. Set variable name as subdomain prefix (e.g. `mydrive`)
4. Manually redeploy to make R2 bindings take effect.

### Authentication

There is no built-in authentication support. By default everyone can read and write your storage. But CloudFlare Zero Trust can be used to protect your data. Do these steps to enable authentication:

1. Enable CloudFlare Zero Trust
2. In **Access**->**Applications**, create a self-hosted application
3. Set **Path** as `api/write/` to disable public write or leave it blank to disable public read
4. Create a policy which accepts your email only
